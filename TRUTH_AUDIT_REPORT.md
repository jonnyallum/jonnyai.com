## CRITICAL: False Location Claim

### Claim: "London-based AI studio"
**Source:** [Footer.tsx:35](src/components/ui/Footer.tsx#L35)
```tsx
London-based AI studio. We build enterprise-grade prototypes...
```

**Verdict:** FALSE

**Note:** The `siteConfig.location` in pricing.ts correctly says "United Kingdom" - but the Footer copy explicitly claims "London-based" which contradicts your actual location.

**Recommended Fix:** Change to accurate location or remove specific city claim.
